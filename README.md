# Group-4-Final-Report
This repository contains the R files submitted by Group 4 for the DSA 6000 Final Report.

## Visualizations
[Visualizations](Michigan.md) of Michigan and the accident dataset were used in this project to identify problem locations and understand the factors that contribute to an accident. [The case study on I-75 Exit 118](Acc_location.md) contains information related to the location with the highest frequency of accidents in Michigan.

## Modeling
[KNN](knn,decision-tree.R), [Ordinal Logistic Regression](Ordinal_Logistic_Regression.R), and [Decision Tree](MI_accidents_for_severity__script__decision-trees.R) Models are also contained in this repository.

## Final Report & Presentation
Our [Final Report](Final_Report.pdf) and [Presentation](Final_Presentation.pptx), as well as our [Midterm Report](Midterm_Report.pdf) and [Proposal](Project_Proposal.pdf) are also contained in this repository.
